The total number of jobs lost alone wont show the impact on the economy assuming higher the wage higher the impact they make
on the economy. How would you differentiate between 2008 crisis or some other crisis and covid 19 crisis otherwise? 
Impact on economy due to covid 19 can be determined by number of jobs  lost multiplied by the average salary normalized 
for every state of laid off employees.
